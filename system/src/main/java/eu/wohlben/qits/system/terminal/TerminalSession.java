/**
 * One live pseudo-terminal: the docker CLI child that runs on it, the bounded scrollback that lets
 * a re-attaching browser catch up, and the sinks currently watching it.
 *
 * <p>Adapted from qits-projects' {@code RemoteLoginSession}. The reader loop, the ring and the
 * end-listener contract are that class's; what changed is written down below.
 *
 * <p><b>The ring is BYTES and the decoder is STATEFUL, which is the one real change.</b> The
 * original decoded each 4 KiB read with {@code new String(buffer, 0, n, UTF_8)}. That is fine for
 * git's prose and wrong for a full-screen program: glances draws with box-drawing characters, a
 * read boundary lands in the middle of a three-byte sequence perhaps once a second, and each one
 * became U+FFFD — a visible hole in the frame that never healed, because the next read's leading
 * continuation bytes were garbage too. One {@link CharsetDecoder} per session, fed with {@code
 * endOfInput=false}, keeps the incomplete tail and decodes it when the rest arrives.
 *
 * <p><b>Replay decodes the snapshot once</b>, with a decode of its own rather than the live one:
 * the live decoder is mid-stream and feeding it the scrollback would corrupt both. The snapshot may
 * itself begin mid-character (the ring drops whole chunks from the front), which costs one
 * replacement character at the top of a replay and nothing after it.
 *
 * <p>The terminal and the process are two objects rather than one: {@link ForeignPty} is only the
 * pseudo-terminal, and the child is a plain {@link ProcessBuilder} one whose stdio happens to be
 * the slave device. Streams and resize therefore come from the PTY, and liveness, exit code and
 * killing from the {@link Process}.
