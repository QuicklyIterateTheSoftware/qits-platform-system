/**
 * <b>The recording docker the story catalogue runs against</b>, and the tap that draws what the
 * launched process asked the daemon for.
 *
 * <h2>Why the docker hop is observed here and not declared</h2>
 *
 * <p>This service never opens {@code /var/run/docker.sock} itself: {@code docker/DockerProcess}
 * <b>spawns the docker CLI</b> and reads its pipes, and which binary that is arrives as one runtime
 * key, {@code qits.system.docker.binary}. So the honest stand-in for its one outbound dependency is
 * not a stubbed endpoint — it is an executable, and this repository has shipped one since long
 * before it had stories: {@code src/test/resources/fake-docker/docker}, which answers in docker's
 * exact output shapes, refuses in docker's own words, and turns {@code run -it} / {@code exec -it}
 * into a real echo loop on a real pseudo-terminal.
 *
 * <p>That is why the docker hop is an <b>observed</b> {@code process} edge rather than a claim. The
 * argv the stand-in receives is the argv {@code DockerArgv} and {@code TerminalArgv} produced, a
 * real {@code ProcessBuilder} forked a real child to deliver it, and the script records it with the
 * exit code it answered. What no tap out here can see is the hop <i>behind</i> that CLI — the unix
 * socket the deployment mounts into this container — and that one edge stays {@link
 * eu.wohlben.qits.userflows.Network#declare declared}. Two hops, and each drawn as what it is.
 *
 * <h2>The catalogue gets its own copy of the binary</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #install()} <b>stages</b> the shipped script into {@code target/story-docker/} and
 * answers that path; the story profile points the launched artifact at it. The copy is not
 * fastidiousness: {@code target/test-classes/fake-docker/} is written by the whole surefire suite,
 * which runs to completion before failsafe starts, so a recording read from there would open with
 * several hundred calls belonging to unit tests. The staged directory is wiped once and then
 * written by exactly one process — the launched artifact — from its first boot call onwards.
 *
 * <p>Which is also why the recording has <b>no floor</b>. The calls this service makes at boot —
 * the daemon probe and the sweep for terminal containers a previous life left behind — are the
 * subject of the first story, the same way the startup JWKS fetch is. The source is registered at
 * zero and the framework's per-source cursor attributes those lines to whichever story drains
 * first, which the class ordering makes the story about them. Run a later class on its own and its
 * first story inherits the boot calls and fails its edge count — loudly, which is the right way for
 * that assumption to break.
 *
 * <p>Everything shared is a file or a system property, because nothing here shares a heap: {@link
 * #install()} is called from a {@code QuarkusTestProfile}, which Quarkus instantiates in more than
 * one classloader, and the stand-in itself is a child process of a <i>second</i> JVM.
 *
 * <h2>What a line becomes</h2>
 *
 * <p>The script records {@code <exit><TAB><arg><TAB><arg>…}, and {@link #summarize} reduces the
 * argv to the sentence a reader of a dependency map needs — {@code info}, {@code system df}, {@code
 * exec -it {digest} sh}. Never the whole command line, for two reasons that are both about the
 * {@code networkHash}: a terminal argv carries {@code QITS_SYSTEM_SESSION=<uuid>} and a glances
 * argv a {@code --name} derived from the same uuid, which are generated per run; and a Go {@code
 * --format} template is full of braces that mermaid reads as syntax. The exit code follows as
 * {@code -> 0}, in the shape an HTTP label's status has, because it is the same half of the
 * evidence: that the call was <i>answered</i>, not merely made.
 *
 * <p>The argv is still assertable in full — {@link #argvOf} reads it out of the same recording. The
 * diagram carries summaries; a claim about a <b>flag</b> (the sandbox flags on a glances run, the
 * canonical id on an exec) reads the argv instead. Same recording, finer question.
