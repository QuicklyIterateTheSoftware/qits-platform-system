/**
 * <b>The machine window</b> — an operator opening the console and reading the host this platform
 * runs on, and then the swarm that host is one node of.
 *
 * <p>The two stories are the two halves of what this service answers, and each one's diagram says
 * something the other's cannot:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>the machine</b>: every number on the first screen is read off the daemon <i>at the
 *       moment it is asked</i>. There is no store here, no cache and no schema, so a size or a
 *       count in the answer can only have come from a docker call this request itself forked — and
 *       the diagram shows every one of them.
 *   <li><b>the swarm</b>: a manager genuinely knows the whole cluster, and what it is allowed to
 *       show of it is a rule rather than a limitation. A config's DATA is decoded into the answer,
 *       because that is what a config is for; a secret's never is, because swarm does not return it
 *       to anybody; and an environment — a service's and a container's alike — is answered as KEYS
 *       only, because that is where a platform service's injected database password lives.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The operator is a person, and a person is a pair of headers.</b> This service authenticates
 * nobody: the platform edge performs the login, strips every client-supplied {@code X-Qits-*}
 * header and injects the identity it decided on. The OIDC tenant this catalogue turns on is
 * bearer-only, so a request carrying no {@code Authorization} falls straight through to that
 * mechanism — which is why these stories can say "an operator" honestly rather than dressing a
 * person up as a machine.
 *
 * <p><b>The docker hop is observed and the socket behind it is declared</b>, and the split is the
 * whole discipline. {@code DockerProcess} forks the CLI and reads its pipes, so {@link StoryDocker}
 * stands in for the binary and records every argv with the exit code it answered: that hop is
 * evidence. What no tap out here stands in front of is the unix socket the CLI then opens, so that
 * one edge — and only that one — is a declaration.
