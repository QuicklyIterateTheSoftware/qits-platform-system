/**
 * The two kinds of caller this service has, and how a story hands each of them to a request.
 *
 * <h2>A person is a pair of headers</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #operator(RequestSpecification)} sends {@code X-Qits-User} and {@code X-Qits-Roles},
 * which is what the platform edge asserts for a logged-in operator and the whole of this service's
 * relationship with human authentication — it authenticates no person itself. That is not a
 * shortcut around the bearer: the OIDC tenant this catalogue turns on is <b>bearer-only</b>, so a
 * request carrying no {@code Authorization} header is never challenged by it and falls through to
 * qits-auth-core's header mechanism, exactly as it does behind the edge. Using it is what lets a
 * read story say "an operator" honestly rather than dressing a person up as a machine.
 *
 * <h2>A machine is a bearer this run's idp minted</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #machine(RequestSpecification)} presents a token signed by {@link MockIdp}'s generated
 * keypair, addressed to this service's audience and carrying {@code qits:system} in {@code groups}.
 * Every token is minted <b>fresh per call and never cached</b>: a helper that handed the same
 * string to two stories would make {@code assertNotLeaked} a weaker claim than it reads as.
 *
 * <h2>Why both, in one catalogue</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the difference between them is a rule this service actually has. Every REST route is
 * {@code @RolesAllowed({"qits:admin", "qits:system"})} — reading the host's shape is something a
 * machine may do — and the terminal socket is {@code @RolesAllowed("qits:admin")} alone, because
 * holding an interactive shell on the platform host is not. A catalogue that only ever spoke as one
 * of the two could not show where the ceiling is.
